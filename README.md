Robot.cs:
The Go () method calculates the speed of the left and right axes, if the left goes to the full (1), and the right one stands (0), then the robot simply turns to the right.

To calibrate the compass so that 0 is straight, and 90 is right, the CurrentDegree () method is written, the Calibration enumeration is added to the beginning of the code for convenience;
